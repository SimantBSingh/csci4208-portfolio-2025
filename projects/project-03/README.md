# Project 3 - JamBoard

**External Repo:** https://github.com/SimantBSingh/JamBoard

## **How to Demo**

1. Open the deployed project link in any browser.
2. From the home screen, select one of the main modules: **Boards**, **Posts**, **Comments**, **Collaborators**, or **Calendar**.
3. Walk through the core workflows:

   - **Boards Dashboard**: View boards you own vs. boards shared with you and create a jam board.
   - **Board View → Posts**: Create a post, view threaded comments, and interact in real time.
   - **Board View → Collaborators Tab**: Add or remove collaborators and view their permissions.
   - **Calendar Module**: Create events, edit events, and visualize your board’s schedule.
4. Switch between different boards to show how all features stay synced.
