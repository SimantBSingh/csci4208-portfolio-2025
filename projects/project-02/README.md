**External Repo:** [https://github.com/IkerAlessandro/CryptoTracker](https://github.com/IkerAlessandro/CryptoTracker/)

## How to Demo
1. The app performs the Core Loop:
   - Checks localStorage for an existing user.
   - If not found, checks the JSONBin database.
   - If still not found, a new user is created.
2. Once the user is identified, the app loads their favorite cryptocurrencies (if they exist).
3. View real-time price information for the tracked coins.
4. Try the main interactions:
   - Add a new cryptocurrency to the favorites list.
   - Remove a cryptocurrency from the favorites list.
   - Watch the auto-refresh update the coin prices.
5. Explore additional cryptocurrencies using the search feature.
